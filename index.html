        <p>Reading is one of my favorite hobbies. Not only does it sharpen my knowledge, it also helps me relax. Whenever I get the time to, I always read a book. Either a story book or just a book giving me information and knowledge. One of my favorite books are "The Diary of a young girl" By Anne Frank and the "Goosebumps" series by R.L Stine. Reading a book can be just as addictive as a T.V show! Sometimes I can't let the book go because of the plot and the contents.</p>
